    <h1>Resisting Bruteforce- cryptohack </h1>

    <h2>Challenge Description</h2>
    <p> If a block cipher is secure, there should be no way for an attacker to distinguish the output of AES from a random permutation of bits. Furthermore, there should be no better way to undo the permutation than simply bruteforcing every possible key. That's why academics consider a cipher theoretically "broken" if they can find an attack that takes fewer steps to perform than bruteforcing the key, even if that attack is practically infeasible.
How difficult is it to bruteforce a 128-bit keyspace? Somebody estimated that if you turned the power of the entire Bitcoin mining network against an AES-128 key, it would take over a hundred times the age of the universe to crack the key.
It turns out that there is an attack on AES that's better than bruteforce, but only slightly â€“ it lowers the security level of AES-128 down to 126.1 bits, and hasn't been improved on for over 8 years. Given the large "security margin" provided by 128 bits, and the lack of improvements despite extensive study, it's not considered a credible risk to the security of AES. But yes, in a very narrow sense, it "breaks" AES.
Finally, while quantum computers have the potential to completely break popular public-key cryptosystems like RSA via Shor's algorithm, they are thought to only cut in half the security level of symmetric cryptosystems via Grover's algorithm. This is one reason why people recommend using AES-256, despite it being less performant, as it would still provide a very adequate 128 bits of security in a quantum future.
What is the name for the best single-key attack against AES?

    <h2>Solution Approach</h2>
    <p>Here are the steps we took to solve the challenge:</p>
    <ol>
 The best publicly known single-key attack against AES is the Biclique attack1. This attack is a variant of the meet-in-the-middle (MITM) method of cryptanalysis and it utilizes a biclique structure to extend the number of possibly attacked rounds by the MITM attack1. The computational complexity of the attack is pow(2,126.1)
,pow( 2,189.7)
, and pow(2,254.4)
 for AES128, AES192, and AES256, respectively
and is teroritical attack so no code for Biclique in this blog for now.but flag is     Biclique
that is name of attack
this is perform sample encrypt decrypt aes and can see from encryption and decryption functions  that find key is hard and can't add here
only return key find by yourself and it on comment

    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_ECB)

# Example AES decryption function for testing
def aes_decrypt(key, ciphertext):
    cipher = AES.new(key, AES.MODE_ECB)
    return unpad(cipher.decrypt(ciphertext), AES.block_size)

# Generate a random 16-byte AES key for testing
key = b'This is a key123'

# Example plaintext
plaintext = b'This is some data we want to encrypt.'

# Encrypt the plaintext using AES
ciphertext = aes_encrypt(key, plaintext)
 
# Precomputation Phase

    # This function should generate bicliques for the attack
    # Placeholder for actual biclique computation
    bicliques = [np.random.rand(4, 4) for _ in range(10)]  # Random example bicliques
    return bicliques

    # Placeholder for matching logic
    # In a real attack, this function would perform complex computations to match biclique
    return np.random.choice([True, False])

# Key Recovery Phase
def recover_key(biclique):
    # Placeholder for key recovery logic
