    <h1>Modes of Operation Starter- cryptohack</h1>

    <h2>Challenge Description</h2>
    <p> The previous set of challenges showed how AES performs a keyed permutation on a block of data. In practice, we need to encrypt messages much longer than a single block. A mode of operation describes how to use a cipher like AES on longer messages.

All modes have serious weaknesses when used incorrectly. The challenges in this category take you to a different section of the website where you can interact with APIs and exploit those weaknesses. Get yourself acquainted with the interface and use it to take your next flag!

    <h2>Solution Approach</h2>
    <p>Here are the steps we took to solve the challenge:</p>
    <ol>
we open link        
and see code go to 
<a href="https://aes.cryptohack.org/block_cipher_starter/encrypt_flag/">https://aes.cryptohack.org/block_cipher_starter/encrypt_flag/</a>
 and see <code>{"ciphertext":"ecc66eb0f6359eb85cda93a63ad91a7852f6002466e25c62eaa82f576aea95de"}</code>
and go this page and get flag as challenge say.
