    <h2>Challenge Description</h2>
    <p> Let’s review some terminology:

Cryptographic Algorithm or Cipher: This algorithm defines the encryption and decryption processes.
Key: The cryptographic algorithm needs a key to convert the plaintext into ciphertext and vice versa.
plaintext is the original message that we want to encrypt
ciphertext is the message in its encrypted form
A symmetric encryption algorithm uses the same key for encryption and decryption. Consequently, the communicating parties need to agree on a secret key before being able to exchange any messages.

In the following figure, the sender provides the encrypt process with the plaintext and the key to get the ciphertext. The ciphertext is usually sent over some communication channel.

On the other end, the recipient provides the decrypt process with the same key used by the sender to recover the original plaintext from the received ciphertext. Without knowledge of the key, the recipient won’t be able to recover the plaintext.

National Institute of Standard and Technology (NIST) published the Data Encryption Standard (DES) in 1977. DES is a symmetric encryption algorithm that uses a key size of 56 bits. In 1997, a challenge to break a message encrypted using DES was solved. Consequently, it was demonstrated that it had become feasible to use a brute-force search to find the key and break a message encrypted using DES. In 1998, a DES key was broken in 56 hours. These cases indicated that DES could no longer be considered secure.

NIST published the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) in 2001. Like DES, it is a symmetric encryption algorithm; however, it uses a key size of 128, 192, or 256 bits, and it is still considered secure and in use today. AES repeats the following four transformations multiple times:

SubBytes(state): This transformation looks up each byte in a given substitution table (S-box) and substitutes it with the respective value. The state is 16 bytes, i.e., 128 bits, saved in a 4 by 4 array.
ShiftRows(state): The second row is shifted by one place, the third row is shifted by two places, and the fourth row is shifted by three places. This is shown in the figure below.
MixColumns(state): Each column is multiplied by a fixed matrix (4 by 4 array).
AddRoundKey(state): A round key is added to the state using the XOR operation.

The total number of transformation rounds depends on the key size.

Don’t worry if you find this cryptic because it is! Our purpose is not to learn the details of how AES works nor to implement it as a programming library; the purpose is to appreciate the difference in complexity between ancient encryption algorithms and modern ones. If you are curious to dive into details, you can check the AES specifications, including pseudocode and examples in its published standard, FIPS PUB 197.

In addition to AES, many other symmetric encryption algorithms are considered secure. Here is a list of symmetric encryption algorithms supported by GPG (GnuPG) 2.37.7, for example:

Encryption Algorithm	Notes
AES, AES192, and AES256	AES with a key size of 128, 192, and 256 bits
IDEA	International Data Encryption Algorithm (IDEA)
3DES	Triple DES (Data Encryption Standard) and is based on DES. We should note that 3DES will be deprecated in 2023 and disallowed in 2024.
CAST5	Also known as CAST-128. Some sources state that CAST stands for the names of its authors: Carlisle Adams and Stafford Tavares.
BLOWFISH	Designed by Bruce Schneier
TWOFISH	Designed by Bruce Schneier and derived from Blowfish
CAMELLIA128, CAMELLIA192, and CAMELLIA256	Designed by Mitsubishi Electric and NTT in Japan. Its name is derived from the flower camellia japonica.
All the algorithms mentioned so far are block cipher symmetric encryption algorithms. A block cipher algorithm converts the input (plaintext) into blocks and encrypts each block. A block is usually 128 bits. In the figure below, we want to encrypt the plaintext “TANGO HOTEL MIKE”, a total of 16 characters. The first step is to represent it in binary. If we use ASCII, “T” is 0x54 in hexadecimal format, “A” is 0x41, and so on. Every two hexadecimal digits constitute 8 bits and represent one byte. A block of 128 bits is practically 16 bytes and is represented in a 4 by 4 array. The 128-bit block is fed as one unit to the encryption method.

The other type of symmetric encryption algorithm is stream ciphers, which encrypt the plaintext byte by byte. Consider the case where we want to encrypt the message “TANGO HOTEL MIKE”; each character needs to be converted to its binary representation. If we use ASCII, “T” is 0x54 in hexadecimal, while “A” is 0x41, and so on. The encryption method will process one byte at a time. This is represented in the figure below.

Example of a stream cipher encryption algorithm applied on an array of bytes

Symmetric encryption solves many security problems discussed in the Security Principles room. Let’s say that Alice and Bob met and chose an encryption algorithm and agreed on a specific key. We assume that the selected encryption algorithm is secure and that the secret key is kept safe. Let’s take a look at what we can achieve:

Confidentiality: If Eve intercepted the encrypted message, she wouldn’t be able to recover the plaintext. Consequently, all messages exchanged between Alice and Bob are confidential as long as they are sent encrypted.
Integrity: When Bob receives an encrypted message and decrypts it successfully using the key he agreed upon with Alice, Bob can be sure that no one could tamper with the message across the channel. When using secure modern encryption algorithms, any minor modification to the ciphertext would prevent successful decryption or would lead to gibberish as plaintext.
Authenticity: Being able to decrypt the ciphertext using the secret key also proves the authenticity of the message because only Alice and Bob know the secret key.
We are just getting started, and we know how to maintain confidentiality, check the integrity and ensure the authenticity of the exchanged messages. More practical and efficient approaches will be presented in later tasks. The question, for now, is whether this is scalable.

With Alice and Bob, we needed one key. If we have Alice, Bob, and Charlie, we need three keys: one for Alice and Bob, another for Alice and Charlie, and a third for Bob and Charlie. However, the number of keys grows quickly; communication between 100 users requires almost 5000 different secret keys. (If you are curious about the mathematics behind it, that’s 99 + 98 + 97 + … + 1 = 4950).

Moreover, if one system gets compromised, they need to create new keys to be used with the other 99 users. Another problem would be finding a secure channel to exchange the keys with all the other users. Obviously, this quickly grows out of hand.

In the next task, we will cover asymmetric encryption. One of the problems solved with asymmetric encryption is when 100 users only need to share a total of 100 keys to communicate securely. (As explained earlier, symmetric encryption would require around 5000 keys to secure the communications for 100 users.)

There are many programs available for symmetric encryption. We will focus on two, which are widely used for asymmetric encryption as well:

GNU Privacy Guard
OpenSSL Project
GNU Privacy Guard
The GNU Privacy Guard, also known as GnuPG or GPG, implements the OpenPGP standard.

We can encrypt a file using GnuPG (GPG) using the following command:

gpg --symmetric --cipher-algo CIPHER message.txt, where CIPHER is the name of the encryption algorithm. You can check supported ciphers using the command gpg --version. The encrypted file will be saved as message.txt.gpg.

The default output is in the binary OpenPGP format; however, if you prefer to create an ASCII armoured output, which can be opened in any text editor, you should add the option --armor. For example, gpg --armor --symmetric --cipher-algo CIPHER message.txt.

You can decrypt using the following command:

gpg --output original_message.txt --decrypt message.gpg

OpenSSL Project
The OpenSSL Project maintains the OpenSSL software.

We can encrypt a file using OpenSSL using the following command:

openssl aes-256-cbc -e -in message.txt -out encrypted_message

We can decrypt the resulting file using the following command:

openssl aes-256-cbc -d -in encrypted_message -out original_message.txt

To make the encryption more secure and resilient against brute-force attacks, we can add -pbkdf2 to use the Password-Based Key Derivation Function 2 (PBKDF2); moreover, we can specify the number of iterations on the password to derive the encryption key using -iter NUMBER. To iterate 10,000 times, the previous command would become:

openssl aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -iter 10000 -e -in message.txt -out encrypted_message

Consequently, the decryption command becomes:

openssl aes-256-cbc -pbkdf2 -iter 10000 -d -in encrypted_message -out original_message.txt

In the following questions, we will use gpg and openssl on the AttackBox to carry out symmetric encryption.
