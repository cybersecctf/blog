    <h2>Challenge Description</h2>
    <p>  
Consider us impressed, Sidney! We caught the spy leaking our weapons technology thanks to your outstanding crypto skills. You deserve a promotion, sir! But first  things first: we intercepted a message that's short. Key information hides in there. Can you decrypt it? Connect to your terminal with the command:  "socat file:`tty`,rawertcp:otp2.2023-bq.ctfcompetition.com:1337". Your password is "Sidney". The enemy hasn't given up on the unbreakable encryption scheme just yet.  HINT: A short key repeats. If it was a one-byte key, you could use frequency analysis to find the key. How can you reduce the multi-byte key case to the one-byte  case?
