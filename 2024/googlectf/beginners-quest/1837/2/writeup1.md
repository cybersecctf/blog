    <h2>Challenge Description</h2>
    <p>Operator, can you decode this radio telegram for us? our predecessor managed to figure out the last two telegrams we intercepted and recorded, but unfortunately  they didn't leave us an explanation of what these messages are encrypted with. We think these messages might all be using the same code and keys, though.HINT: We have evidence that suggests that these messages were all written down in 7 columns when they were being encrypted. Could this be useful somehow?         
FLAG FORMAT: FLAG{example} except in challenge 2

    <h2>Solution Approach</h2>
    <p>Here are the steps we took to solve the challenge:</p>
